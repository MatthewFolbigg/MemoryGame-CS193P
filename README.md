#### A simple card based memory game
- Tap on a card to turn it face up and reveal its content 
- Try to tap a second card with content matching the first
- If they match you gain points and are removed from the game
- If they dont match they turn back to face down
- keep trying to match cards untill all of them have been removed from the game
- The faster you match cards the higher your score will be
